  <h2>1. Overview of the Service</h2>
  <p>CricCoachAI is a cricket coaching assistant that allows users to upload videos and images of their performance for feedback using AI-powered tools, specifically utilizing APIs from OpenAI and Anthropic. The app uses Firebase Authentication for secure login and account access.</p>

You are solely responsible for activity under your account. You must notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorized access to your account.</p>

  <h2>3. User Content</h2>
  <p>When you upload videos or images for analysis, you retain ownership of that content. However, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, and revocable license to transmit your media to OpenAI and Anthropic for processing and return of analytical results.
